# Bag of Words

## Description
Quick and dirty implementation of a Bag-of-Words to query words or sentences and see which artists are most likely to use them.

## How to use:
Change the query in the main()-function at the end of bagofwords.py to check probabilities for your query and the already existing artists (see lyrics folder)

If you want to check your query for other artists you have to download their lyrics first. 
download_lyrics.py can crawl azlyrics.com for your artist and download the lyrics in the correct format. Just change the artist in the download_main() function.
